Description: HMNM (Hierarchical Multilayer Network Models) provides functionality for 
    constructing and analyzing multilayer networks, where layers are organized by a hierarchy 
    of categories from different factors. Analytic capabilities include 
    network diffusion (RWR) and module identification (AMEND).
